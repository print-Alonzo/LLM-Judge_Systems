    "explanation": "Accuracy and Completeness are 0 because the idiom 'raining cats and dogs' is literally translated, failing to convey the meaning of heavy rain. Cultural Appropriateness is 0 due to the literal calque of a foreign idiom. Fluency and Guideline Adherence are 1 as the Filipino grammar is correct and no external guidelines were violated."
