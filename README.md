# LLM-Judge_Systems
Develops and compares two LLM-based judges for English-to-Filipino translation: one prompt-engineered and one agentic. Both assess translation quality with scores and explanations. Highlights trade-offs in reasoning, reliability, and evaluation depth, inspired by Gu et al. (2025).
